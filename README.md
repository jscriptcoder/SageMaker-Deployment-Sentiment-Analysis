# SageMaker Deployment of Sentiment Analysis

Final Project of [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), consisting of development, testing and deployment of a model (Sentiment Analysis) using [AWS Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). The notebook and Python files provided here, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.
